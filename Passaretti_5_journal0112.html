  <h3>1/12/16</h3>
  <p>I was moderatly successful with the webpage given yesterday. I got all of
  the main components in. Like the color, spacing, and overall formatting.
  However, I had an issue with placing the yellow and red boxes. this was because
  the container I placed them in made the text touch the side of the window. I
  moved it over, but that  made a small black line on the side of the page.
