  <p>I was overall very successful with everything. They were not perfect
  because of the time limits, but I worked the best I could in the given time.
  The reviews were easy, because all you really had to do was fidget with the
  CSS. I was successful with the 2nd business webpage mainly becasue I worked
  on it from home everyday. Most of the time spent was typing the paragraphs,
  which was why I had an easier time with the review.</p>
