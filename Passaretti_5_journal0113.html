  <h3>1/13/16</h3>
  <p>I was very successful in the 2nd review compared to the 1st review. It
  took a lot of css, but it came together nicely. The biggest problem I had
  was the positioning of the divs. I learned that when something has a absolute
  location while it's inside another div, it's absolute just in that div.</p>
